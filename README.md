Ask the following questions:

* What is a schema?
  * A schema is the structure of a database system, including its tables, relationships, and constraints.
* What is a collection?
  * A collection is a group of documents in a non-relational database, and is analogous to a table in a relational database.
* What is a document?
  * A document is a structured set of data in a non-relational database, and is analogous to a record in a relational database.
* What's the difference between relational and non-relational databases?
  * Relational databases have schemas that define their structure. Each record in a table follows the same format and rules, and can include references to records in other tables. By contrast, documents within a collection don't need to follow the same format, and have no enforced relationship with documents in other collections. Any schema concerns are enforced outside of the database.
* What is a primary key?
  * A primary key uniquely identifies a record in a table.
* What is a foreign key?
  * A foreign key is a reference to the primary key of another table.
